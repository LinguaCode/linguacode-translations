# linguacode-translations

## Description
This repository contains translation files for LinguaCode. The main reason that I've separated from the [LinguaCode's Core](https://github.com/LinguaCode/core) is that in this way it will be much more easy to make a translations.
If you've any kind of suggestions, that can help with the translations (like some corrections), you can open issue [here](https://github.com/LinguaCode/linguacode-translations/issues).

### to developers
Until we haven't automatized every peace of $hit, to convert translations into a usable data:

1. Download the whole archive of the last build translation from the [Crowdin's LinguaCode page](https://translate.linguacode.me/project/linguacode/).
2. Extract the content into a **tools/json2tree/input/** folder.
3. Run `npm run json2tree`.
4. Move all content from **tools/json2tree/output/** into a **languages/**.
5. Create a pull request.
