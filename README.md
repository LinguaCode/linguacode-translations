# linguacode-translations

## Description
This repository contains translation files for LinguaCode. The main reason that I've separated from the [LinguaCode's Core](https://github.com/LinguaCode/core) is that in this way it will be much more easy to make a translations.
If you've any kind of suggestions, that can help with the translations (like some corrections), you can open issue [here](https://github.com/LinguaCode/linguacode-translations/issues).
